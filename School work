<p> This ice skater was a bit of a learning curve because of the use of different human anatomy then I'm used to.
I want to design her outfit as well because fashion design is something that I'm interested in.
The use of the blue background was supposed to give off ice. 
I wanted to draw an ice skater because I really love them.
I think they are so pretty and the character was based on a character in a book I read. </p>
